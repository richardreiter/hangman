# WEIRD WORD HANGMAN

[Weird Word Hangman](https://github.com/richardreiter/hangman) is a Python terminal based word guessing game, which runs on Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.

There's a hidden weird word and the player needs to guess a letter (or the whole word) in each round.

The player has 6 lives, each wrong guess deducts a life from the player. If the player runs out of lives they hang the man and the player loses.

The player wins the game if they correctly identify all the hidden letters!
